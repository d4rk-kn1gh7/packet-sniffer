# A Network Monitoring using a Packet Sniffer implemented from Scratch

Packet sniffing is a technique of intercepting each packet as it travels through the network. It can be explained as the method by which a user sniffs data belonging to other network users. Packet sniffers can be used as a management tool or for malevolent intent. It is determined by the user's intention. They are used by network administrators to monitor and validate network traffic. Packet sniffers are essentially applications that read packets as they go through the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) layer's network layer. The data is evaluated when the packets are obtained from the network layer. In this project, we are deploying the packet sniffer with the help of a Raspberry Pi.
